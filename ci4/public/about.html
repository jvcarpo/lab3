			<p>My name is Jarvis. I am 20 years old and studying Bachelor of Information and Technology at Asia Pacific College. 
			I love everything around popular culture, from music to movies to television. 
			I spend much of my free time keeping up with the latest news and gossip regarding celebrities, upcoming films, television projects, 
			reality shows, and politics. They used to call this kind of people "chronically online." 
			While people may see my hobby as shallow, surprisingly, I learn many interesting and informational things from it.
			<br><br>One piece of media that I love at the moment is RuPaul's Drag Race. It is a whole personality of mine at this point. 
			I watched the show in Grade 10 when I first got my Netflix account and have been hooked ever since. 
			It is a reality show based on drag queens and hosted by RuPaul. 
			They are tasked to complete different challenges from comedy, design, singing, acting, hosting, and improv to win a cash prize of $200,000.
			It is over-the-top, funny, serious, and emotional, basically everything you can ask for in a show. My favorite queens are Symone, 
			Bob the Drag Queen, Alexis Mateo, Jujubee, Bosco, Lawrence Chaney, Vinas Deluxe, and Tayce.
			<br><br>I feel like I talked about Drag Race more than myself on this page but I only did this to fill in the huge division I made in the html lmao.
